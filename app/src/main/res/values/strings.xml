        At the beginning, you will see the image that has been around the world and ensures that if you see a specific number, you can have the following conditions:\n\n

        3246: Astigmatism and myopia \n
        3240: Astigmatism\n
        1246: Myopic of light without Astigmatism\n
        1240: Healthy eyes.\n\n

        Although specialized doctors assure that an accurate diagnosis can not be taken by this image.\n\n

        They asked those who have vision problems that despite the number they see, it is preferable that they consult a specialist and not draw conclusions without a medical check-up.\n\n

        Knowing the above, look for 3 seconds, what number do you see?
